	SecurityInformation               AN   // ISA04 Security Information - This is used for identifying the security information about the interchange sender or the data in the interchange; the type of information is set by the Security Information Qualifier (I03).
	InterchangeSenderIDQualifier      ID   // ISA05 Interchange ID Qualifier - Code indicating the system/method of code structure used to designate the sender or receiver ID element being qualified. This ID qualifies the Sender in ISA06.
	InterchangeSenderID               ID   // ISA06 Interchange Sender ID - Identification code published by the sender for other parties to use as the receiver ID to route data to them; the sender always codes this value in the sender ID element.

	InterchangeReceiverID             ID   // ISA08 Interchange Receiver ID - Identification code published by the receiver of the data; When sending, it is used by the sender as their sending ID, thus other parties sending to them will use this as a receiving ID to route data to them.

	InterchangeControlNumber          int  // ISA13 Interchange Control Number - A control number assigned by the interchange sender.
	AcknowledgementRequested          bool // ISA14 Acknowledgement Requested - Code indicating senderâ€™s request for an interchange acknowledgment.
	TestIndicator                     bool // ISA15 Test Indicator - Code indicating whether data enclosed by this interchange envelope is test, production or information. P - Production, T - Test.
	ComponentElementSeparator         ID   // ISA16 Component Element Separator - The component element separator is a delimiter and not a data element; this field provides the delimiter used to separate component data elements within a composite data structure; this value must be different than the data element separator and the segment terminator.
